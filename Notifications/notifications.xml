<Body Lang="en" Caption="New Action Packs">New Voice and DW3305 Action Packs Available

Use the Add on Manager to install them

Voice Pack 10 adds on many new events to the voice system found in ED 3.3. It also allows you more control over text received voice output due to the additional text channels found in ED 3.3

DW3305 pack will download to your bookmarks the DW star systems and planet bookmarks.  Use this in conjunction with your compass overlay to guide you accurately to offical meeting up points

Press the acknowledge button to never see this message again!

Good luck Commanders.

It has been brought to our attention that this service has been suspended, pending updates to it.

To help the commander who runs this site please disable this service in your commanders settings.

Go into Settings | Commanders, select your commander, click EDIT and then disable uploading of data to EGO by unsetting "Sync to EGO".

This will lower any load on his servers and also make EDD more happy!

Sorry for the interruption but we thought this was important.

We will inform you of any updates to this service when we are advised.

Safe Flight.

Rob and the EDD Team.

<Body Caption="Odyssey Update" Lang="en">
******************************
Update the program to 12.0.2 if you are going to play the Odyssey Alpha

Frontier have changed their method of marking journal files for this alpha and thus EDD will be confused
and update your standard commander, instead of creating a commander with the prefix BETA

Once you update, your Odyssey play will be in the commander [BETA] name

Thanks
